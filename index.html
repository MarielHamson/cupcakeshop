    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>During <span class="highlight">the great
        quarantine of 2020</span>,
      Mariel "Rawr" Hamson, came up with
      a unique idea that melded her love
      of cupcakes and monsters. She
      started baking for herself and her
      family and eventually moved on to
      taking online orders through
      Instagram and Facebook (all while
      properly socially distancing!).
    </p>
    <p>As things took off, she expanded
      to multiple brick & mortar
      locations in the Portland area
      including:</p>

    <h3> What makes us <span class="emphasize">different</span>
      ?</h3>
    <p>Each cupcake is lovingly made
      with a different monster peeking
      out from chocolate ganache
      frosting
      once you take a <span class="emphasize">bite</span>.

        <p class="border">The Yeti
          (/ˈjɛti/) or Abominable
          Snowman is a folkloric
          ape-like creature taller than
          an average human,that is said
          to inhabit the Himalayan
          mountains. The names Yeti and
          Meh-Teh are commonly used by
          the people indigenous to the
          region, and are part of their
          history and mythology.</p>

        <p class="border">In Scottish
          folklore, the Loch Ness
          Monster or Nessie (Scottish
          Gaelic: Uilebheist Loch
          Nis[4])
          is said to be a creature that
          inhabits Loch Ness in the
          Scottish Highlands. It is
          often described
          as large in size with a long
          neck and one or more humps
          protruding from the water.
          Popular interest
          and belief in the creature
          have varied since it was
          brought to worldwide attention
          in 1933. Evidence
          of its existence is anecdotal,
          with a few disputed
          photographs and sonar
          readings. </p>

          <p class="border">For people
            with social anxiety, the
            disorder is seen as a
            horrifying, scary, terrible
            monster.

            <p>also called the Lernean
            Hydra, in Greek legend, the
            offspring of Typhon and
            Echidna
            (according to the early
            Greek poet Hesiod's
            Theogony), a gigantic
            water-snake-like monster
            with nine heads (the number

            Los Angeles, the legendary
            ghost La Llorona is stalking
            the night -- and the
            children.
            Ignoring the eerie warning
            of a troubled mother, a
            social worker and her own

            a character in the
            Anglo-Saxon epic poem
            Beowulf (AD 700–1000).
            He is one of the poem's
            three antagonists (along
            with Grendel's mother and
            the dragon),
            all aligned in opposition
            against the protagonist
            Beowulf. Grendel is feared
            by all in Heorot but
            Beowulf.</p>
